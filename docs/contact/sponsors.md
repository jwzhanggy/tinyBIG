# Sponsors

We welcome financial support for the project from sponsors, investors, and funding organizations.

## Call for sponsorship and investments

`tinybig` is an open-source project developed and maintained by a small team at IFM Lab. 
As an academic research team, we rely on financial funding, investments, and support to cover 
research costs, hire new team members, and purchase equipment for the project.

## How to support

Interested investors and sponsors may contact [Jiawei Zhang via email](mailto:jiawei@ifmlab.org).

## How it started

The `tinybig` library is developed and implemented by Jiawei Zhang at IFM Lab as a side research project 
for model evaluations in the [RPN 1 paper](https://github.com/jwzhanggy/tinyBIG/blob/main/docs/assets/files/rpn_paper.pdf) 
and [RPN 2 paper](https://github.com/jwzhanggy/tinyBIG/blob/main/docs/assets/files/rpn_2_paper.pdf).

Through extensive experimental investigations, we discovered the potential of `tinybig` as a general framework to unify 
diverse machine learning and deep learning models. 
This motivated us to develop and release this library as a public package.

## Future plans

`tinybig` is an on-going research project. RPN v3.0 is currently in development, aiming to further improve the current 
RPN model in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and learning algorithms. 

After testing and evaluating these new methods, modules, and models, we will gradually incorporate them into the `tinybig` library. 
Mature models developed from the `tinybig` projects will be commercialized and published subsequently.

We estimate that RPN v3.0 and `tinybig` v0.3.0 will be released before the mid of 2025.
