# Tutorials

## Before You Begin

Before reading tutorials in this tab, you may need to first check the [Get Started](../guides/index.md) tab to follow the 
[Installation](../guides/installation.md) guidance to install the latest `tinybig` and its dependency packages. 

Also you are recommended to read the [Quickstart Tutorial](../guides/quick_start.md) to get familiar 
with the basic modules and models provided in the {{toolkit}} toolkit before reading tutorials in this tab.

The tutorials in this tab are primarily prepared based on 
[the RPN paper](https://github.com/jwzhanggy/tinyBIG/blob/main/docs/assets/files/rpn_paper.pdf). 
We recommend reading that paper first for detailed technical information about the {{our}} model and {{toolkit}} toolkit.
