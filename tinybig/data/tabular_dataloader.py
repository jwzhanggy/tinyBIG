    """
    A dataloader class for handling tabular datasets.

    This class extends the base `dataloader` class to support loading, processing,
    normalizing, and splitting tabular datasets for machine learning tasks.

    Attributes
    ----------
    data_contents : list or tuple, optional
        Raw tabular data contents, directly provided or loaded from a file.
    train_batch_size : int
        The batch size for training datasets.
    test_batch_size : int
        The batch size for testing datasets.

    Methods
    -------
    __init__(name, data_contents, train_batch_size, test_batch_size, ...)
        Initializes the tabular dataloader.
    load_file(cache_dir, filename)
        Loads data from a file.
    load_raw_data(data_contents, cache_dir, filename)
        Loads raw data either from `data_contents` or a file.
    process_data(data_contents, cache_dir, filename, str_converted_to_numerical, ...)
        Processes raw tabular data into structured formats.
    load_complete_data(data_contents, cache_dir, filename, ...)
        Loads and processes the entire dataset into feature and label tensors.
    normalize(input, normalize_type, normalize_range)
        Normalizes a tensor using specified normalization techniques.
    split(X, y, split_type, train_percentage, fold, random_state, shuffle)
        Splits the dataset into training and testing datasets.
    load(cache_dir, filename, split_type, train_percentage, fold, random_state, shuffle, ...)
        Main method to load, normalize, and split tabular data.
