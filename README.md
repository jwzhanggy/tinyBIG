    primaryClass={cs.LG}
}
```

### Installation

You can install `tinybig` either via `pip` or directly from the github source code.

#### Install via Pip

```shell
pip install tinybig
```

#### Install from Source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jwzhanggy/tinyBIG.git
```

After entering the downloaded source code directory, tinybig can be installed with the following command:

```shell
python setup.py install
```

If you don't have `setuptools` installed locally, please consider to first install `setuptools`:
```shell
pip install setuptools 
```

### Install Dependency

Please download the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/jwzhanggy/tinyBIG/blob/main/requirements.txt) file, and install all the dependency packages:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Verification

If you have successfully installed both `tinybig` and the dependency packages, now you can use `tinybig` in your projects.

To ensure that `tinybig` was installed correctly, we can verify the installation by running the sample python code as follows:

```python
>>> import torch
>>> import tinybig as tb
>>> expansion_func = tb.expansion.taylor_expansion()
>>> expansion_func(torch.Tensor([[1, 2]]))
```
The output should be something like:
```python
tensor([[1., 2., 1., 2., 2., 4.]])
```
